## Introduction

This repository serves as my personal storage for all my configs and programs I need when setting up a new Mac. It is also a good way to keep track of all the changes I make to my system.

## How to use?

> Do at your OWN risk. I am not responsible for any damage to your system. This has been tested on my personal MacBook Pro, but it may not work on your system or it may set many things up that you do not want.
> The repo is set up to work with my personal preferences and may not work for you.
> I strongly suggest to clone, and adapt the scripts to your own needs.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git@github.com:bajcmartinez/dotfiles.git
```

or using HTTPs:

```bash
https://github.com/bajcmartinez/dotfiles.git
```

2. Run the setup script

Now wait for a bit until everything bootstraps, you may be required to enter your password a few times.

3. Restart your system
